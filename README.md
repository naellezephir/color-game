# Synopsis

Fun, interactive game color matching game that uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Users try to match the RBG color displayed on the top. Each wrong guess and the incorrect color is eliminated from the screen, but a correct guess floods the screen with the RGB color. 

# Motivation

Wanted to create a quick, aethetically pleasing web application while reviewing my skills.
